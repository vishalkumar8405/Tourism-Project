			      		One of the char dhams, the Kedarnath Temple welcomes lakhs of devotees every year. The pilgrims undertake an arduous but devotional journey to reach this 3,584-m high shrine dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple is one of the 12 jyotirlingas (devotional shrines of Lord Shiva) in the country, and is thus considered specially holy. The sanctum sanctorum houses a conical rock formation that is worshipped as Lord Shiva’s Sadashiva (ever auspicious) form. This 1,000-year-old temple is made out of giant stone slabs arranged over a rectangular platform.
			      	<p>
			      		There is an interesting legend behind this religious place. It is said that Lord Shiva turned himself into a bull to evade the Pandavas when they were looking for him to seek atonement for their sins after fighting the epic Mahabharata battle. When the Pandavas spotted Lord Shiva, he hid inside the ground, leaving only the hump visible on the surface of the earth.

			      		A place, which holds so many myths and legends, Badrinath acquires predominance in the travel itinerary of a pilgrim. The popular belief is that Badarinath was the domain of Lord Shiva, and Lord Vishnu managed to unseat Shiva from here to Kedarnath. Another belief is that when Ganga made her descend to earth she split up in to twelve streams and one among the channels.

			      		Kedarnath is a holy town nestled in the Himalayas. Located in Uttarakhand, it is one of the most sacred pilgrimages of Lord Shiva and is one of the famous Char Dham sites. This scenic city offers a tranquil ambiance with its snow-white peaks, luscious landscapes, green forests and vibrant rhododendrons. Renowned for the Kedarnath Temple, the city is both a religious center and an idyllic holiday destination. It is not just the devout, but also the people who love to conquer the rough terrain of Garhwal, who visit this hilly land.

			      		The other spots to visit in Kedarnath are the Bhairava Temple, Gandhi Sarovar or Chorabari Lake (a beautiful glacial lake), Son Prayag and more. Chandrashila is a summit located just 89km from KedarnathIn and is one of the most popular trekking and hiking spots in the region. Here one can shop for herbs, precious stones, shawls, religious items and more.

			      		Kedarnath is one of the uppermost of the Jyotirlingas, and due to this high elevation, it is reachable only half of the year. The winters are harsh and the temple becomes unreachable. The stunning temple structure, built with vast white stones, is supposed to have been built approximately a thousand years ago. It houses, along with the main deity Lord Shiva, the idols of Nandi (Shiva's mode of transportation) and Virbhadra, lord Shiva's guard. There are also idols of the Pandava brothers in the temple, telling the tale of Mahabharata and their connection with this temple as well as lord Shiva.

			      		One of the twelve Jyotrilingas dedicated to the Sadashiva form of lord Shiva and the third shrine in Char dham, Kedarnath is a magnificent temple situated at a height of 3581m. In the temple a huge statue of Nandi stands. There are a number of hot water springs called as Kunds in Kedarnath. Among which Shiv Kund is the most important and Rudhir Kund is famous for its red colored water. 
			      	</p>
			      	<p>
			      		Among the chardham, Kedarnath is situated at the highest altitude. It is reached after a 14 km trek from Gaurikund.
